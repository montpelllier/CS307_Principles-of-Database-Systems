# README

We recommend you to change the passwd at the first time you log in since all the submission will be recorded and calculated to your Assignment score and maybe a duplicate test after the DDL.

Do not submit any malicious code, all records will be backed up in the database, once found you will fail the Assignment & Course.

After submitting the code, it will automatically jump to the record interface, please refresh to view the results.

The database on OJ is not the same as the one posted to the class, which means that it is possible that your results and output are the same, but that does not mean that your results are correct. The final results are based on the OJ test.
